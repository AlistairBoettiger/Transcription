Code to implement Markov chain analysis of molecular assembly processes that can be decomposed by pinchpoints.
All code implemented in Boettiger, Ralph, and Evans is included in this toolbox.  This package can also be found at: [http://alistairboettiger.info/home/Software.html](http://alistairboettiger.info/home/Software.html)
For an updated version of the toolbox, please see our Github repository:

This repository includes all the code used in my work with Peter Ralph and Steve Evans:

Most of the code development for this project was version-managed through git as it was created, so you can see here the history of the code development.
